# AAOXXL1-AutoSplit
Auto-Splitter for the game Astérix &amp; Obélix XXL on PC

# Functions
 - Automated splits for individual routes (splits if a level is entered for the first time)
 - Option included to support segmented runs (auto-start/split will change accordingly)
 - Loadless timer to mitigate hardware differences
 - Automated end split after the final boss lever (frame perfect)
 - Dynamic start if wished (can start after loading a level from the overworld instead of the standard start after the intro movie)
 - Dynamic signature patterns (should be somewhat patch save)
 - The splitter enables the support for all known ingame languages (Wanna play XXL in French, German, English, Italian? - No worries, this splitter got your covered!)
 
 # Compatibility
 This auto-splitter was successfully tested on the following versions of the game:
 
 **v1.0** - Standalone (taken from an original World of Asterix CD & patched with the Ipafix 64-Bit patch to make it run under W10).
