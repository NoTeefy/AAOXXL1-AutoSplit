# AAOXXL1-AutoSplit
Auto-Splitter for the game Astérix &amp; Obélix XXL on PC

# Functions
 - Automated splits for individual routes (splits if a level is entered for the first time)
 - Option included to support segmented runs (auto-start/split will change accordingly)
 - Loadless timer to mitigate hardware differences
 - Automated end split after the final boss lever (frame perfect)
 - Dynamic start if wished (can start after loading a level from the overworld instead of the standard start after the intro movie)
 - Dynamic signature patterns (should be somewhat patch save)
 - The splitter enables the support for all known ingame languages (Wanna play XXL in French, German, English, Italian? - No worries, this splitter got you covered!)
 
 # Compatibility
 This auto-splitter was successfully tested on the following versions of the game:
 
 **v1.0** - Standalone (taken from an original World of Asterix CD & patched with the Ipatix 64-Bit patch to make it run under W10).
 This splitter will only work with the two official .elb Modules from our Discord! Make sure that the checksums of these correspond to those (you can use http://onlinemd5.com/ to get the checksums of your elb modules):
